          <h3>A long doze</h3>
            <p>Many bears are dormant in winter which means they doze or sleep non stop for a long time. They eat during <br>
              <em> summer</em> and <em>atunm</em> months to build fat that they can live off in winter.<br>
              Cubs are born on this time.</p>

          <h3>Climbing bears</h3>
          <p>Bears normally walk slowly,but if they feel they need they gallop at very high speeds.<br>
             It may see unlikely because of their size,but most bears are also able to climb trees.<br>
